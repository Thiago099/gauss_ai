There are six variables in the equations given: W1, W2, W3, W4, W5, and B1, B2, B3. However, there is no mention of the variable W6 in any of the equations. We'll assume that this was a mistake and that the third equation should read:

y1 * W5 + y2 * W6 + 1 * B3 = y3

With that assumption, we can proceed to solve for each variable in terms of the given values:

W4 = D1/W1 (divide both sides of the first equation by x1)
D2 = x2 * W4 * W2 (multiply both sides of the first equation by x2)
B1 = y1 - x1 * W1 (subtract x1 * W1 from both sides of the first equation)
W5 = D4/W3 (divide both sides of the second equation by y1)
D5 = y2 * W4 * W5 (multiply both sides of the second equation by W4)
B2 = y2 - x1 * W3 - x2 * W4 (subtract x1 * W3 + x2 * W4 from both sides of the second equation)
B3 = y3 - y1 * W5 - y2 * W6 (subtract y1 * W5 + y2 * W6 from both sides of the third equation)

We can then substitute the expressions we've found for W4 and W5 into D2 and D5, respectively:

D2 = x2 * D1 * W2 / W1
D5 = y2 * D1 * W5 / W1

This gives us the following expressions for each variable:

W1 = D1/W4
W2 = D2 * W1 / (x2 * D1)
B1 = y1 - x1 * (D1/W4)
W3 = D4/W5
W4 = D1/W1
B2 = y2 - x1 * (D4/W5) - x2 * (D1/W1)
W5 = D4/W3
B3 = y3 - y1 * (D4/W3) - y2 * W6
W6 = (y3 - y1 * (D4/W3) - B3) / y2

Note that if we substitute W4 and W5 back into the original equations, we can check that they hold for the given values of D1 through D6 and y1 through y3.
